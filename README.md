## Prerequisites

- MATLAB installed on your computer.
- git installed. if you have mac, git is aleady installed; else if windows, please install Git. [(view steps below).](#git-installation-guide) 
## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/williammcmp/TimeStonks.git
    ```

2. Open MATLAB and navigate to the project folder.

## Usage

1. Open the `main.m` script in MATLAB.

2. Edit the `folderPath` variable to specify the directory where your AFL data is stored.

3. Run the script in MATLAB to execute the desired analysis and generate visualizations.

## Important files

- [main.m](/main.m) - Main Script (run everything from here)

Forecasting scripts üìàüìâ - Taken from the Labs (nothing crazing is happening). Each forecast model function or script will include a üß™ validation output to the command window. üòé

- [AR1Model.m](/AR1Model.m) - AR(1) Model Fit and Forecast script
- [meanModel.m](/meanModel.m) - Mean Model Fit and Forecast script
- [naiveModel.m](/naiveModel.m) - Naive Model Fit and Forecast script
- [MA1Model.m](/MA1Model.m) - MA(1) Script (WIP)

Folders üìÅ
- [data/](/data/) (Directory of all Data Files required for Assigment)

Helper Functions ‚öí (plots and loading data)
- [initalPlots.m](/initalPlots.m) - Plots the Raw data's ACF and PACF
- [loadExcel.m](/loadExcel.m) - Excel Data Loading Function
- [loadText.m](/loadText.m) - Text Data Loading Function
- [swtest.m](/swtest.m) - Shapiro-Wilk Test Function (saves you having to download it again)

## Git Installation Guide

**This whole part should be skipped if you download the .zip version of this. Click on the Green code button near the top of the screen.** 

### Introduction

This guide will help you install Git on your computer. Git is a powerful version control system used to track changes in software development projects.

### Installation Steps

#### Windows

1. Download Git for Windows from [https://git-scm.com/download/win](https://git-scm.com/download/win).

2. Run the downloaded installer.

3. Follow the on-screen instructions, leaving all options at their default settings unless you have a specific reason to change them.

#### macOS

1. Download Git for macOS from [https://git-scm.com/download/mac](https://git-scm.com/download/mac).

2. Run the downloaded installer package (it has a `.pkg` extension).

3. Follow the installation prompts. You may need to enter your password to complete the installation.

#### Linux (Ubuntu as an example)

1. Open your terminal.

2. Install Git using the package manager for your distribution. For Ubuntu, you can use `apt`:

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install git
   ```

### Verification

To verify that Git is installed correctly, open your terminal or command prompt and run:

```bash
git --version
```

You should see the Git version information, confirming a successful installation.

### Configuration

After installing Git, configure your name and email:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

Replace "Your Name" and "your.email@example.com" with your own information.

### Getting Started

You're now ready to use Git for version control in your projects. Start by creating a new repository or cloning an existing one. Refer to Git documentation and tutorials for further guidance.
