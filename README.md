## Git Installation Guide

### Introduction

This guide will help you install Git on your computer. Git is a powerful version control system used to track changes in software development projects.

### Installation Steps

#### Windows

1. Download Git for Windows from [https://git-scm.com/download/win](https://git-scm.com/download/win).

2. Run the downloaded installer.

3. Follow the on-screen instructions, leaving all options at their default settings unless you have a specific reason to change them.

#### macOS

1. Download Git for macOS from [https://git-scm.com/download/mac](https://git-scm.com/download/mac).

2. Run the downloaded installer package (it has a `.pkg` extension).

3. Follow the installation prompts. You may need to enter your password to complete the installation.

#### Linux (Ubuntu as an example)

1. Open your terminal.

2. Install Git using the package manager for your distribution. For Ubuntu, you can use `apt`:

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install git
   ```

### Verification

To verify that Git is installed correctly, open your terminal or command prompt and run:

```bash
git --version
```

You should see the Git version information, confirming a successful installation.

### Configuration

After installing Git, configure your name and email:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

Replace "Your Name" and "your.email@example.com" with your own information.
